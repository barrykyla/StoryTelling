# Story Telling

***
This piece is a visual story book. It is based off of the book The Secret Garden. It is
supposed to simulate walking through a green house that is haunted by a ghost. The use 
of transparency provides a haze to the piece that elevates it from just a click through 
story book. This is also the first exploration of linked pages from one to another in html.
